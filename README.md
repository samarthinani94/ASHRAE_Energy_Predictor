ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III

In this project we aim to predict the mean hourly energy consumption of buildings with various energy meter types. Currently, buildings are charged for energy consumption using a "pay for performance" approach where they compare energy usage of building retrofitted with energy efficient technology vs. how much energy it wouldâ€™ve used without this technology. A model is needed to predict the latter value, and that is what we aim to do in this project.
